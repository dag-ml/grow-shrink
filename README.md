Building off of the findings of ["Validating Causal Diagrams of Human Health Risks for Spaceflight: An Example Using Bone Data from Rodents,"](https://www.mdpi.com/1813442) this project explores, in collaboration with the authors of this study, to explore Machine Learning approaches to generate Directed Acyclic Graphs using the [Grow-Shrink Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1407.8088).

## Getting Started üë©‚ÄçüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ
You can get started by cloning the repository and running `notebooks/growshrink_notebook.Rmd` in RStudio or VS Code. The file `notebooks/growshrink_notebook.nb.html` can also be downloaded to read through the file as a learning resource in your web browser. 

The output graphs of Grow-Shrink, and an Exploratory Data Analysis are available in the `graphs/` directory.

## Objectives/Road Map üöÄ
- [ ] Generate a DAG that can be validated or invalidated by a domain expert
- [ ] Identify or develop a validity score that can measure the degree of congruency with another graph
- [ ] Determine Grow-Shrink's level of adaptability to generate DAGs for HSRB medical risk assessment for astronauts
- [ ] Ensure that DAGs are ML-ready -- can they be used to fit the parameters to a Bayesian Network?

    ### Additional Objectives/Stretch Goals
    - [ ] Rewrite `notebooks/growshrink_notebook.Rmd` as an R Script file
    - [ ] Convert source code to Python or C++ for further reusability
    - [ ] Generalize code for any dataset that meets standards for OSDR's TRANSFORMED datasets

## Data üê≠
All data from this project is publicly available through [NASA's Open Science Data Repositories](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/). If you would like to automate the use of data please download the following CSV files and place them in a directory called `data/` on the same level as the `notebooks/` directory. The notebook will use this structure to load the files relatively from the R Notebook file for you. Otherwise, you will be prompted to load the files through a file explorer.
